Abilities are added to the Ability Manager (AM) via the ManagerManager instance obtained via the getMM() method


ex.
    getMM().add(new Haste( caster , target));

Notes: getMM() is available to all GameElements


When they cast they add themselves to their targets Active Abilities list which will apply their ability via the doAbility() method.


When they are done they will be removed from the AM.
The target will remove the ability from its Active Abilities list when they ability returns true for isOver()
